RELEASES

0.2.1b  29.05.2001   BUG fix related to opening sdif files that do not
		     contain any ASCII chunk.

0.2.1   29.05.2001   Fixed memory leak from version 0.2.0. Added automatic
                     closing of input files if new file is opened and old 
	             file still not closed. Added cleanup routine that closes
                     file in case of clear.

0.2.0   28.05.2001   Added support for reading char data and 1NVT frames 
                     and matrices. The initial loadsdif call now returns
		     the ASCII chunks of type 1NVT and 1IDS, that make up
                     the header of the SDIF file, as a single string.

0.1.9   14.05.2001   Added support for writing char data and 1NVT frames 
                     and matrices. 1NVT matrices have to be specified
                     as cell string arrays of size Nx2 (N rows and 2 columns) 

0.1.8b  03.05.2001   Removed inconsistency with SDifTypes.STYP
		     of SDIF Version 3.3. Now correct    SDifTypes.STYP
                     is included.

0.1.8   20.03.2001   added a source distribution. New makefile
                     with only three parameters to be adjusted
		     to support compilation in different environments.
		     reliability of "make test" improved. 
		     binary distribution linked with sdif 3.3

0.1.7b  07.02.2001   Added README.first for clarification of
                     proper library initialization

0.1.7   20.12.2000   Added support for matlab 6

0.1.6   19.12.2000   Fixed Bug in loadsdif - crash when last matrix 
                     was not selected
                     Corrected sgi mex extension to mexsg such 
                     that sgi is now in distribution

0.1.5   27.08.2000   Clarified empty matrix issue:  The doc was wrong!
		     loadsdif did always return empty time as eof flag.
		     loadsdiffile and loadsdifflat now use the flag right and 
		     don't stop on empty matrices.

0.1.4	08.08.2000   Fixed 'last matrix not returned' bug, 
		     added README with release notes to distribution.

0.1.3	05.08.2000   Types file now included in distribution and documentation.

0.1.2   04.08.2000   Added reset of file variable, prevents crash on 
		     double-close.  Version number is written in NVTs.

0.1.1	27.06.2000   first release
