Support for shared libraries
============================

The default behavior of the configure script is to enable 
the use of shared librairies. While libtool
exists for MacOSX most versions are not working properly.
Therefore, we recommand to disable creation of shared libraries
under  MacOSX  by means of adding the configure
option --disable-shared to the configuration command line.
So under MacOSX the prefered configuration command line would read

> ./configure --disable-shared
