LIBRARY
 * SdifTextConv.h
 *
 *
 * Convert a pseudo-sdif text file to a sdif file
 *
 *
 * author: Dominique Virolle 1997

DESCRIPTION
   La librairie possède deux fonctions permettant de faire des conversions
   de fichiers SDIF binaire vers du texte ou l'inverse.

LOG
 * $Log: not supported by cvs2svn $
 * Revision 3.5  2000/11/21 14:51:51  schwarz
 * - sdif.h is now included by all sdif/Sdif*.c files.
 * - Removed all public typedefs, enums, structs, and defines from the
 *   individual sdif/Sdif*.h files, because they were duplicated in sdif.h.
 * - Todo: Do the same for the function prototypes, decide which types and
 *   prototypes really need to be exported.
 * - Removed SdifFileStruct.h.
 * - Preliminary new version of SdiffGetPos, SdiffSetPos.  They used the
 *   type fpos_t, which is no longer a long on RedHat 7 Linux.
 *
 * Revision 3.4  2000/10/27 20:03:46  roebel
 * autoconf merged back to main trunk
 *
 * Revision 3.3.2.1  2000/08/21  21:35:56  tisseran
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 3.3  1999/09/28  13:09:16  schwarz
 * Included #include <preincluded.h> for cross-platform uniformisation,
 * which in turn includes host_architecture.h and SDIF's project_preinclude.h.
 *
 * Revision 3.2  1999/08/25  18:32:38  schwarz
 * Added cocoon-able comments with sentinel "DOC:" (on a single line).
 *
 * Revision 3.1  1999/03/14  10:57:26  virolle
 * SdifStdErr add
 *
 * Revision 2.1  1998/12/21  18:27:44  schwarz
 * Inserted copyright message.
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1998/11/29  11:42:11  virolle
 * - New management of interpretation errors.
 * - Alignement of frames with CNMAT (execpt specials Chunk 1NVT, 1TYP, 1IDS).
 * _ Sdif Header File has a Sdif format version.
 * - Matrices order in frames is not important now. (only one occurence of
 *   a Matrix Type in a Frame Type declaration )
 * - Hard coded predefined types more dynamic management.
 * - Standart streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) set as binary for Windows32 to
 *   have exactly the same result on each plateforme.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1998/11/10  15:31:57  schwarz
 * Removed all 'extern' keywords for prototypes, since this is redundant
 * (function prototypes are automatically linked extern), and it
 * prohibits cocoon from generating an entry in the HTML documentation
 * for this function.
