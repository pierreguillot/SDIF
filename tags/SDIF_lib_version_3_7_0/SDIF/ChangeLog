Version 3.5:
	
-- Fixed bugs in preincluded.h and UniversalEnvVar.h (thanks to Kelly Fitz for pointing out the problem).
-- Fixed sdif output bug in sdifextract.

	
Version 3.4:
	
-- Added defines SDIF_VERSION_MAJOR/SDIF_VERSION_MINOR
	for version indication.
-- No more warnings if the number of columns exceeds the number defined 
	in the types file.
-- Minor changes in the default sdiftypes file.

	
Version 3.3:
	
-- Modification of standard SDIF description types initialisation: 
	The types can now be defined in the file SdifTypes.STYP OR 
	a built-in definition can be used. This allows effectively 
	to drop the SdifTypes.STYP file altogether and avoid 
	frequent installation problems.
	The name of the built-in definition string is SDIFTYPES_STRING 
	(in file sdiftypes.h). This string is used by SDIF library 
	when the file SdifTypes.STYP define at compilation (in directory 
	datadir, by default /usr/local/share or $PREFIX/share) or 
	file specified in environnement variable SDIFTYPES is not found.   
	TODO: This string is generated at IRCAM, by a perl script 
	which should be included in future version
	of library.
-- Fix for autoconfiguration tools.  autoconf will now work on all
	UNIX-like operating systems (OSF1, IRIX, Linux and Mac OS X).
	Beware, we have suppose than in each platform will use 
	configure mechanism, the directory divider is "/".
	TODO:  We will include a test at configuration 
	to know the directory divider use on Operating System.
