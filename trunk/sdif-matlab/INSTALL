How to compile matlab sdif tools
================================

1.) Compile and install the sdif library version 3.2.2 or above.

2.) Edit the  makefile to specify the location of your mex script,
the sdif library/include file location and the installation directory.
(For compilation of sdif tools for matlab 5 and 6 you may specify 
two different mex commands devided by spaces.)

3.) run:

make 

4.) For testing run:

 make test 

Not all tests are very meaningful. However, they should run without 
a crash. The first (testrw) and the last (t1.sdif) have some sort of
result checking and should report an error if the output is not correct.

5.) to install files run:

 make install

6.) Have fun!
