 * Revision 2.2  1999/01/23  13:57:28  virolle
 * General Lists, and special chunk preparation to become frames
 *
 * Revision 2.1  1998/12/21  18:27:11  schwarz
 * Inserted copyright message.
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1998/11/29  11:41:34  virolle
 * - New management of interpretation errors.
 * - Alignement of frames with CNMAT (execpt specials Chunk 1NVT, 1TYP, 1IDS).
 * _ Sdif Header File has a Sdif format version.
 * - Matrices order in frames is not important now. (only one occurence of
 *   a Matrix Type in a Frame Type declaration )
 * - Hard coded predefined types more dynamic management.
 * - Standart streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) set as binary for Windows32 to
 *   have exactly the same result on each plateforme.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1998/11/10  15:31:42  schwarz
 * Removed all 'extern' keywords for prototypes, since this is redundant
 * (function prototypes are automatically linked extern), and it
 * prohibits cocoon from generating an entry in the HTML documentation
 * for this function.
