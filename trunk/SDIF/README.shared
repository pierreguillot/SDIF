Support for shared libraries
============================

The default behavior of the configure script is to disable 
the use of shared librairies due to problems with libtool under 
Mac OSX. If you are not using Mac OSX you may consider
to switch on the cration of shared libraries by means of
adding the flag --enable-shared when calling the configure script.
