# Introduction

Easdif is an Easy Interface to the SoundDescription Interchange Format.

Easdif is a  high level API to the functions of  the SDIF Library.  By
means  of encapsulating  all  low level  functions  into classes  with
intuitive  user interface  the  involved handling  of  the SDIF  files
becomes much  simpler. Nevertheless all the deeper  levels of handling
SDIF files  as for examples Name  Value Tables and  embedded types are
accessible with Easdif.

libEasdif contains all objects from  SDIF compiled with a c++ compiler
to  facilitate error  handling  by  means of  exceptions.  Due to  the
complete availability of  SDIF in Easdif it can be  used as a complete
SDIF replacement library.


# Installation and compilation

Since  version 1.3.0  of Easdif  the main  build  system configuration
system is based on cmake (see: www.cmake.org). cmake is similar to the
automake tools, however, it is much faster and supports a large number
of compilers and  operating systems.  (Currently Makefiles and
 gcc or icc compiler on Linux,  Xcode or Makefiles using gcc on Mac OS
X,  Visual C++  and Borland  C++ on  Windows and  other  build systems
should be directly supported.
 

To configure  and compile Easdif  using the cmake  build configuration
you need to extract the Easdif  distribution, and create and cd into a
dedicated build directory.  On Linux and Mac OS X you may then call

cmake path_to_easdif_src
make 
make install

To configure and compile using Xcode you may use the sequence

cmake -G Xcode path_to_easdif_src

which will create the Xcode  project in the current directory. Yuo can
then load the project and compile  with Xcode. For windows you need to
run  the cmake  gui.  Select  the  source directory  and the  compiler
options  you like,  configure until  all settings  stabelize  (no read
field appears in the dialog) and then create the selected project.

The installation  will install shared  versions of the Easdif  and the
SDIF  libraries  as well  as  the SDIF  command  line  tools that  are
included in the Easdif distribution.

Easdif provides a number of swig wrapper templates that can be used to
work  with  SDIF  files  from   python,  perl  or  java.  For  further
information look into swig/README.

For  the moment  the automake/autotools  build configuration  is still
supported. For generic instructions look into the file INSTALL.


# Documentation

The  programmer documentation  of  the Easdif  library  can either  be
downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdif  or if doxygen is
installed may be generated from the local sources by means of calling

> make doc

in a configured source directory.
