# Introduction

Easdif is an Easy Interface to the SoundDescription Interchange Format.

Easdif is a high level API to the functions of the SDIF Library.
By means of encapsulating all low level functions into classes
with intuitive user interface the involved handling of the
SDIF files becomes much simpler. Nevertheless all the
deeper levels of handling SDIF files as for examples Name Value Tables
and embedded types are accessible with Easdif.

libEasdif contains all objects from SDIF compiled with a c++ compiler
to facilitate error handling by means of exceptions. Due to the complete
availability of SDIF in Easdif it can be used as a complete
SDIF replacement library.



# Installation and compilation

To compile Easdif you need to extract an SDIF archive into the Easdif
directory and rename it to SDIF. All SDIF versions later then 3.7.1
should work.

For further information refer to the file INSTALL



# Documentation

The programmer documentation of the Easdif library can either be 
downloaded from http://www/ircam.fr/sdif or if doxygen is installed
may be generated from the local sources by means of calling

> make doc

in a configured source directory.
